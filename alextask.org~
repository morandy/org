There are several procedures related to setting up Opti infrastructure that we need to automate to improve our operating procedures and enable disaster recovery:
The output for this should be a github wiki page, serving as a table of contents and requirements discussion (what is in each) of each script. The scripts themselves should be in separate files. Implement this as a subdirectory in the existing OptiRTC/Devops repository.
* TODO [#A] Analysis
** Provision a new Azure IaaS VM
*** With the following software on it:
- Chrome + LastPass
- LinqPAD 4 (Any PC)
- Visual Studio 2013 (free version should be OK)
- A recent build of OptiRTC .dlls (find me when you need this... maybe we set up a private nuget server)
*** Such that:
I can spin them up as readily and easily as possible. I imagine this means figuring out how to build an image of this machine that can then be used everywhere. I know https://www.packer.io/ is probably a good tool for doing this.
* TODO Deploy new White label 
** Create new Azure Website
** Create new Access Control Service Identity
* TODO Workflow and Disaster Recovery
** Deploy new SQL database from local .bacpac file or private cloud blob .bacpac, given a connection string of an Azure-compliant SQL database server. 
** Provision an Access Control Services namespace
** Provision Redis Cache
** Export an entire Azure Table, or collection of <PartitionKey, RowKeyRange> tuples to a CSV file, persisted in either a blob or in a local file
** Provision a Web Role and Install a Certificate in it
** Provision a Worker Role and Install a Certificate in it
** Provision a new Service Bus namespace, and generate non-admin keys with read and read/write permission levels.
** (verify that all needed queues and relays are generated by their consuming service on configuration setting change)
** Clear all of the exported data files older than {date} from OptiRTC data export history
** Provision all OptiRTC Tables in an Azure Table Storage Account
