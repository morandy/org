Notes on AppVeyor
* Testing
** testing can produce XML of results
- Upload from build script to Test results endpoint, will be added to Tests tab
*** test results endpoint format:
https://ci.appveyor.com/api/testresults/{resultsType}/{jobId}
- resultsType - test framework name to parse text results (mstest, xunit, nunit)
- jobId - build job ID that is currently running, can be read from APPVEYOR_JOB_ID env variable
** configuring tests
- Only for Premium*
- Set up tests in visual studio with a category attribute
#+NAME: TestCategory Visual Studio
#+BEGIN_SRC c-sharp
[TestMethod, TestCategory("A")]
public void MyTest()
{
}
#+END_SRC
- Then in appveyor.yml, include "categories:" and break it down
#+NAME: parallel tests yaml
#+BEGIN_SRC yml
test:
  categories:
    - Common       # A category common for all jobs
    - [UI]         # 1st job
    - [DAL, BL]    # 2nd job
#+END_SRC
